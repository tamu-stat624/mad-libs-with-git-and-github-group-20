Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Alex,

I am writing to you from a gigantic spaceship in a beautiful galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a red rocket in August. There are Ten Animals and Plants of Mammal here! In the
Zachary there is a pool full of Water. I fall asleep each night on a calm bed of
water and dream of flying high . It feels as though I have lived here for
centuries now. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a giant spaceship!!

Best wishes,
Jayesh
